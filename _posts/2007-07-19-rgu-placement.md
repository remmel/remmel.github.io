The subject was to develop a control system for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using **image processing**.

Thus, the main part of my work was to write algorithms to process images captured by the webcam.

Algorithms wrote:

  * Lines and rectangles detection (using Hough space instead of Cartesian space).
  * Circle detection with its center.
  * Edge detection.
  * Color detection (using HSV color space instead of RGB).
  * Luminosity detection.

Once, environment is know, the AUV must move by activating its 3 motors. To control the motors from the a PC, the board K8055 is used.
