[<img title="KustAdventure : personnalized game to gift" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_2016-12-18-16-42-03-994_com.kustgame.kustmario-300x168.png" width="300" height="168" />](http://www.KustGame.com)

As a side project, I&#8217;m developing [KustGame](http://www.KustGame.com) a mobile video game where you can :

  * personnalize the player
  * add custom pictures
  * add special messages

The idea came when looking for a original way to offer a gift to my girlfriend : she had to finish the game to get the message indicating where was hidden the gift.

In order to have quickly a product to sell, I used :

  * [GameMaker](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), since the software allowing you to develop quickly and easily a game compatible with iOS, Android, windows, html5
  * [Mobirize](https://mobirise.com/), to create the static homepage without the need of knowing HTML (for free).
  * Plain PHP without framework to develop the simple backend (no Java, no Symfony)
  * Shared host
  * jQuery to add nice interactions in the customize form (no angular, no backbone)
  * PayPal for its simple API (NVP)

The aim of that version is to be as simple as possible and to test if there is a market.

The video game is planned to be sell before Christmas and published on the AppStore (iPhone) and Google Play Store (Android). By the way, Christmas is in 7 days, so the deadline is imminent.
